The buyer has to be satisfied he/she received what they thought they were getting and the seller has to be sure he/she gets paid. i-Escrow holds payment from the buyer in trust until the seller sends the merchandise to the buyer. Once the buyer accepts the merchandise, i-Escrow forwards the payment to the seller by writing a check.  A typical escrow transaction: When an auction ends, your end of auction email contains links to i-Escrow. Once you have signed up with i-Escrow   you go through the following steps to complete your transaction. 1.   Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the merchandise along with email address of the other party. 2.   The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction. 3.   Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means. 4.   i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer. 5.   The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment. 6.   The buyer receives and accepts the merchandise. 7.   i-Escrow sends the check to the seller.',\n",
